# CID-hack

We are building an advanced digital surveillance tool designed to empower law enforcement agencies (LEAs) in combating cybercrimes effectively. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, it provides comprehensive capabilities for detecting, investigating, and preventing illicit activities in the digital realm.

## Features

- **Server Information Leakage Detection:** Query Apache server mod_status to identify inadvertent information leakage, aiding in understanding infrastructure supporting potentially illicit activities.
- **Open Directories and Backup Scanning:** Systematically check for open directories and explore backup copies of websites to uncover vulnerabilities and potential data leaks.
- **EXIF Data Stripping from Images:** Strip EXIF data from images to remove geolocation and other identifying information, enhancing the capability to track the origin or movement of illegal goods.
- **Keyword Search on Forums:** Perform proactive keyword searches on dark web forums to detect and prevent activities related to drugs, stolen information, or other criminal endeavors.
